# HR-management-system

Day01 : Created the website with the info of the employees in the console <br><br>
Day 02 : Used the document.write to display the employees info on the website no the console and also create a constructor to make things eaiser while creating objects

Day 03 : I actually face some issue doing the code but at the end I did it . it took me sometime to figure out how to seperate each deparment from the others but after all I did all of that using ids and classes .
